1. npx create-expo-app frontend
2. cd frontend
3. npx expo start (then exit)
4. npm install react-native-maps

    - AIzaSyCBZD28SfZeIxWtvqXyn_oRTu2NbQxfI5c
6. Follow steps from react-native-maps github
    - MapView, Marker, PROVIDER_GOOGLE
7. Go to the Routes API from Google, and translate the curl request to fetch, while putting your API Key
8. Decode the encodedPolyline by using import polyline from '@mapbox/polyline', also install it;
9. Create <Polyline /> component while passing the correct attributes
10. npm install react-native-google-maps-directions
11. Do backend for orders, MUST use command "python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"
12. Download ngrok to get temporary HTTPS server. 
    - Use command "ngrok http 8000"
    - Copy and paste the "https://...." Forwarding link, then test the endpoint out in postman
13. Use that as the fetch for the api
14. NOTE, here I must use an anonymous arrow function to wrap the function call to pass parameters



NOTE!! One error that could happen, is when leaving/restarting the app, the order could still be going on, and leaving would cause
    the order to completely be unavailable!
